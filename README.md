# Hybrid-Cloud
This project involves the integration of AWS services, OpenFaaS, Ceph, and other tools to perform cloud-based video processing and data analysis. The primary goal is to develop a system that can handle automated video analysis tasks, such as face recognition, using serverless functions and distributed storage.
